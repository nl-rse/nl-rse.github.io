The current core team is made up of volunteers, who have taken the task of setting up the NL-RSE community.
As the NL-RSE community grows, the core team feels it is important to be transparent about how the core team is selected and what their responsibilities are. It is also important that the whole NL-RSE community has the opportunity to select who represents them in the core team. For this reason, this year we will be holding the first election in NL-RSE history!
