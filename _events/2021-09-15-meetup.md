## Abstracts

### Data+Code+Software=PDF

[Adina Wagner](https://twitter.com/adinakrik?lang=en)

A demonstration of one of many ways to write an automatically reproducible research article, and a generic framework for actionable linkage of all building blocks of a project.

### Executable Research Article (ERA): Enrich a research paper with code and data

[Giulia Guizzardi](https://twitter.com/GiuliaGuizza)

Since 2017, [eLife](https://twitter.com/elifeinnovation?lang=en) has been working on the concept of computationally reproducible papers. The open-source suite of tools that started life as the Reproducible Document Stack is live since August 2020 on eLife as ERA, the Executable Research Article, delivering a truly web-native format for taking published research to a new level of transparency, reproducibility and interactivity.
At the moment, authors with a published eLife paper can register their interest to enrich their published work with the addition of live code blocks, programmatically-generated interactive figures, and dynamically generated in-line values, using familiar tools like R Markdown and Jupyter in combination with Stencila Hub’s intuitive asset management and format conversion interface. The resulting new ERA publication will be presented as a complement to the original published paper. 
Readers of ERA publications are able to inspect the code, modify it, and re-execute it directly in the browser, enabling them to better understand how a figure is generated. They are able to change a plot from one format to another, alter the data range of a specific analysis, and much more. All changes are limited to an individual’s browsing session and do not affect the published article, so anyone can experiment safely. Readers can also download the ERA publication – with all embedded code and data preserved – and use it as a basis for further study or derivative works.

### Computing, statistics and reproducibility: pedagogical reflections

[Fernando Perez](https://twitter.com/fperez_org?lang=en)

In this talk Fernando will discuss a course taught in the UC Berkeley statistics department, where they try to combine epistemological reflections on open and reproducible science, statistical considerations for data analysis that leads to robust and trustworthy results, and computational practices that support these ideas.  They use tools from the Scientific Python and Jupyter ecosystem, and try to imbue the students with a practical appreciation of the real-world practice of open, collaborative science by working on open source projects, recently published literature and data.  

The main ideas behind this approach can be implemented with other choices of tools as well, so we hope this discussion will be of interest to those who use different tools.
