## Abstracts

### The grand-challenge platform for medical imaging

Paul will give an interactive demo of The grand-challenge platform for medical imaging. The demo will highlight the capabilities of the platform as a tool for integrated annotation of medical imaging, with applications for learning & verification for AI systems.

### NIDM (Networking during Infectious Disease Model)

Recent research shows an increasing interest in the interplay of social networks and infectious diseases. Many studies either neglect explicit changes in health behaviour or consider networks to be static, despite empirical evidence that people seek to distance themselves from diseases in social networks. With our application we experiment with a model that integrates theories of social network formation from sociology, risk perception from health psychology, and infectious diseases from epidemiology.

### Discussion panel: RSE groups

Research Software Engineering groups are increasingly common as part of universities and medical centers. These groups provide support to researchers in developing research software and are key in conducting open and reproducible digital research. In this panel we have invited members of such groups to answer questions about their experiences in conducting research projects in such a context.
