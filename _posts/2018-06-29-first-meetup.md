Registration is open for the first meeting of the Netherlands Research Software Engineers Community ([NL-RSE.org](http://nl-rse.org/)). This event will provide a unique opportunity to those who develop and contribute to research software in the Netherlands to come together and help shape up this recently started community, which follows on the success of similar initiatives in the [UK](https://rse.ac.uk/) and [Germany](http://www.de-rse.org/de/). 

### Who should attend?
* Whether you work at a Dutch academic institution, national research facility or knowledge institute, commercial company or any other organisation...
* Whether you see yourself as professional software developer, a researcher who spends  time coding, or a mix of both...

...if you write or contribute to research software in the Netherlands and beyond, then you should attend. 

### What to expect

The program will include short keynote speeches, interactive sessions, and plenty of time for discussion and networking. One of the goals of the event is to bring together everyone in the Netherlands who has an interest in research software and identify the topics that are important and of common interest to the community. In true Dutch style, there will also be time for beer and bitterballen at the end! 

The meeting will be in English and the capacity will be limited to around 60 participants. Therefore, please register soon as you can, as the registration form will close when full capacity is reached.
