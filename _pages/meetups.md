The NL-RSE meets on regular basis, every two months on average.

Netherlands eScience Center, DTL and SURF frequently organise NL-RSE meetups to encourage
collaboration and communication between Research Software Engineers in the Netherlands.

During the Covid19 pandemic, meetings will be organised online.

Topics of the lectures and hands-on workshops range from new developments in programming languages
and frameworks to practical tips for research software engineers, and more.
Speakers are usually but not exclusively members of the NL-RSE community (i.e. Dutch Research Software Engineers). The agenda of the meeting leaves plenty of time for participants to interact with each other.

NL-RSE meetups are the continuation of DTL SURF Programmers meetings. You can learn more about those and see past agendas on [DTL website](https://www.dtls.nl/community/meetings/programmers-meetings/).
