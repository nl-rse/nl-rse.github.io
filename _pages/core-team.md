Thomas Pronk develops and consults on technology for psychological research. He is interested in mental chronometry, which is making inferences about the mind based on how fast it responds. This interest involves research software engineering and behavioral data science, with special considerations for the circumstances under which data is collected. His main employer is the University of Amsterdam, Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences. On the side, he does community gardening and a Ph.D. in mental chronometry via the internet.
